What is a table?

A table is a collection of related data. In relational databases, a table consists of
a pre-defined number of columns with an 'unlimited' amount of rows. Tables also
have associated with them some metadata. Some examples of table metadata are
constraints, table name, column names, and column types.

One way to implement a table using purely Python is by taking an object oriented
approach and creating a class with methods that will allow the object to
behave like a relational table.

When creating a table, the database engine needs to know some things. These things
are: table name, column names, column types, if a column is auto-incrementing,
if a column is nullable, whether a column is the table's primary key, whether
a column should have unique values, if the column is a foreign key to another table.

A simple create table where all the user is required to provide is 
table name, column names, and column types could look like the following:

table_0 = Table(
    table_name='table_0',
    column_names=['column_0', 'column_1', 'column_2'],
    column_types=['column_0_type', 'column_1_type', 'column_2_type']
)

To handle storage, the object would contain a dictionary of dictionaries. It would
contain a data dictionary and a metadata dictionary. The nested dictionary
would look similar to the following:

table = {
    "data": {
        0: "column 0 data",
        1: "column 1 data",
        2: "column 2 data",
        ...
    },
    "metadata": {
        "column_names": {
            0: "column 0 name",
            1: "column 1 name",
            2: "column 2 name",
            ...
        },
        "column_types": {
            0: "column 0 type",
            1: "column 1 type",
            2: "column 2 type",
            ...
        }
    }
}

NOTE: The above example table does not include constraints in the table's metadata. This
is because I'm currently unsure of how to implement them.

Some basic behavior of a relational table would be your standard CRUD
operations, that is Create Read Update Delete.

The Create operation adds new information to a relational database. This information
is in the form of a row or multiple rows. This operation is akin to the
INSERT operator in SQL.
